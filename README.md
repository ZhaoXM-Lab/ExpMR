# An augmented Mendelian randomization approach provides causality of brain imaging features on complex traits in a single biobank-scale dataset
The scripts are for our work which emploies a MR framework to infer cell type-specific causal relationships between gene expression and brain-associated complex traits, using eQTL data from eight cell types and large-scale GWASs of 123 imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and 26 brain disorders and behaviors (DBs).
