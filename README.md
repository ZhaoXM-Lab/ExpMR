# ExpMR
In this work, we employ a MR framework to infer cell type-specific causal relationships between gene expression and brain-associated complex traits, using eQTL data from eight cell types and large-scale GWASs of 123 imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) and 26 brain disorders and behaviors (DBs).
